  Memory plays an important role in making an Android application famous. The application will run faster on the Android ecosystem with less memory requirement.
  Android ecosystem tries to keep as many applications in memory as possible to enable quicker & smoother switching between applications and tasks, keeping a device feeling “snappy” to the end user.
  So, the lesser the memory requirement, the faster the app will run on a device.

  So to enhance the user experience and to strengthen the Android ecosystem, memory pressure will be directly proportional to app stability, thus bringing memory leaks into the picture.

  High memory leaks lead to sluggy apps or skipping frames during its execution or even termination of your application in the middle of critical work. And finally, you may end up with a crash report that doesn't appear to be memory related.

  Most developers do not focus on memory leaks till they are noticeable due to ANR / Out of memory errors, at which point they require a significant rewrite. During development and testing, using tools such as LeakCanary can help you detect and resolve memory leaks.

  But now it's time to explore LeakCanary 2 & Integration with a dashboard like Firebase to analyze memory pitfalls for apps. Just a simplified way to detect memory leaks during development and testing automation.
  How to prioritize bugs by collecting all memory leaks in a dashboard (Not all bugs are worth fixing. Only fix the ones that matter.

  So let's fix the leak in this great ship to sail high !!
