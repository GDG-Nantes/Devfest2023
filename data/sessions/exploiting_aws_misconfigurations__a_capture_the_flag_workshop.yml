  Are you ready to become a hacker and try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Cloud?
  Then join us for our exciting Capture the Flag workshop where youâ€™ll learn about the dangers of AWS environments configurations pitfalls and how to exploit them.

  This workshop will cover the following topics: S3, EC2 instance, Lambda code injection, IAM privesc, Policy rollback, ...

  By the end of this workshop, you will have a better understanding of the potential misconfigurations impact on your own AWS infrastructures and the steps you can take to secure them.

  ## Prerequisite
  As we cannot cover for the expense of multiple AWS environments, this workshop requires you to have a working AWS account with admin privileges and have Terraform installed on your laptop.
  We will provide you a Terraform script to deploy a vulnerable by design AWS environment, but fear not, it will only be accessible by your IP, and will be destroyed at the end of the workshop.
