  Certain tasks on a user interaction can be blocking, giving the user a broken experience, and resulting in a low INP metric score.

  Some ways to optimise the INP value of your page could be:

  - keeping tasks small and dedicated to what they should do.
  - using Chrome’s scheduler API to schedule tasks for browser
  - yield important tasks to the main thread

  The talk dives deeper into ways of improving the potentially next CWV, "Interaction to Next paint" of a page.
