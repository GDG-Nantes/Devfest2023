  Incident management can be challenging and throw you curveballs with unexpected issues, resulting in data loss, downtimes, and overall money & hours of sleep going to waste, BUT! There are practical things you could do to make it a smoother process and handle it better.

  Remember when we were at school, and people said - "Actively listening in class guarantees 50% prep for the upcoming test"?
  The same goes for being proactive at work in ways that will instantly prepare you to manage incidents better (at night or in general).

  In this talk, I'll cover the proactive ways you could take and incorporate into your day-to-day routine, in order to prepare you for a smoother and more efficient incident management process.

  I will also show the best practices I've finalized over the years that helped me get a clear vision of how to manage production incidents in the quickest & efficient way possible.
  Embracing the tips I'll give you will guarantee you'll not only talk the talk but also walk the walk when it comes to incident management.
