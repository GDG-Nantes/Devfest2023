  Building software has always been a passion of mine. This is still true after almost 15 years of experience in various environments and business sectors. I've never really considered it work but "problems to solve". Yes, I love puzzles or anything that requires you to turn your head around. Passion also means curiosity and hunger for knowledge. I regularly read blogs, articles, and books and practice katas by myself. Continuous improvement is a mindset I consider essential.

  If I had to pick one priority when building a product, I would choose quality. This has always been what I put first. I'm not satisfied when "It Works", it must also be done well. I always tried to improve the team I joined wherever I've been. Whether by providing experience, a fresh eye, ideas, or mentoring younger peers. About mentoring, sharing knowledge represents a key aspect of my participation in a team. I do believe that knowledge is useless if you keep it to yourself. We need to use our knowledge to teach and inspire others, the same way others have inspired us.

  Putting this all together, it’s quite clear I advocate Software Craftsmanship. Hearing about this ideology for the first time has been one of the biggest milestones in my career. It is the perfect match for what I consider important in terms of mindset. Since then, I’ve continuously tried to spread the ideology by sharing ideas and methodologies.
